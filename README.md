Statement of contribution (see below)



Project Objectives (0.5 page max):

[^]: What is the goal of the project?

My goal for a this project is to make a virtual Theremin with the raspberry pi. A Theremin is a musical instrument invented by 'Leon Theremin'. This Instrument is unique to other instrument due to it being able to be played with out any contact by the musician. When using the Theremin, you wave your hands around two metal (radio-type) ‘aerials’ and this change the pitch and volume of a note (shown below).

Review and Discussion of Technologies Used (5 pages max):

[^]: High level discussion of the technologies used, why were they used, alternatives, how they work (high level) and how they relate to the technologies presented in lectures.



 I will achieve this by using distance sensors, two of them, one for the pitch and the other controls the volume of the note.

Design and Implementation (5 pages max):

[^]: Discuss details of the design and implementation, how it works, challenges you faced, configuration, experimentation, results, etc. Include a system diagram and discuss future directions / improvements.
